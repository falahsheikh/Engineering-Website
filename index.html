                <p>Welcome to my professional profile. I am Abdul Hady Shaik Hassan, a seasoned electrical engineer with extensive experience in project execution and quality assurance. Connecting my passion for the intricacies of power systems with my commitment to quality assurance, I have played a pivotal role in shaping and maintaining critical infrastructures.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>I am a dedicated individual with a proven track record in overseeing and executing projects related to power distribution and utility management. My expertise spans various roles, where I have excelled in ensuring the seamless integration of electrical systems in compliance with international standards.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>In my current role as Project Executor & QA/QC Inspector at MARAFIQ Power and Utility Company in Yanbu, KSA, I orchestrate Power Connection Requests for diverse projects within the Royal Commission Yanbu. I conduct inspections and tests for equipment and cables, adhering to international standards and leading project execution in accordance with NEC, IEC, IEEE guidelines.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>During my tenure as QC & Quality Inspector/ Electrical Foreman from 2002 to 2020, also at MARAFIQ, I evaluated technical aspects of distribution network projects, ensuring quality and adherence to specifications. I pioneered electrical distribution activities, overseeing installation, testing, and commissioning. I also played a key role in training and mentoring personnel in testing commission activities and QA/QC documentation.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>From 1991 to 2002, as Substation Maintenance Electrical Foreman Gas Insulated Switch Gear (GIS) at the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu, I undertook preventive and corrective maintenance of GIS, transformers, and circuit breakers. My expertise included high-voltage testing, diagnostic maintenance, and troubleshooting of various equipment.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>In my earlier role as Electrical Commissioning Foreman from 1986 to 1991 at RESOURCE SCIENCES ARABIA LTD in Yanbu, I conducted commissioning tests on transformers and carried out preventive and corrective maintenance on various electrical systems.</p><br>
                    
                    <p>Driven by a passion for excellence and a commitment to the highest standards, I bring a wealth of experience and expertise to any project. My journey has been marked by achievements, recognition, and a relentless pursuit of knowledge in the dynamic field of electrical engineering. If you seek a professional with a proven track record and a dedication to quality, I am ready to contribute to your endeavors.</p><br>
